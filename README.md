Hi! This is Vatsal, a student from Chandigarh University working on improving my coding skills and practicing problem solving. I am also doing a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, therefore aware of many concepts regarding that as well. I love to learn and have an open mind for suggestions and inputs, there are some things I love to do such as watching YouTube to find out awesome facts about my machines and spending time reading & solving problems. If you are reading this, I suggest you to reach me out, we can talk and share some thoughts.
